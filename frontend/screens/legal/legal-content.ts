You can instead enter your address manually. Separately, with your permission, JhelumKart can save a fresh device location, its accuracy and capture time at checkout to help with delivery. It is saved securely with the order and can be viewed by the order admin. Order locations are retained with order records unless you delete your account, which removes them. You can deny location permission and still place an order. The app does not capture location on startup or track location in the background. You can revoke location permission in device settings; this stops future capture but does not delete previously saved order locations. Latest-location records saved by older app versions expire after 30 days.',

Deletion removes your profile, saved addresses, cart, favourites, device tokens, sessions, reviews and return photos.
